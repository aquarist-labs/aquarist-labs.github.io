* General
  * Appreciate that things are a little slow-going at the moment, still
    working on the new project plan and adjusting expectations

* Backend
  * Removing etcd:
    * key/value data can be stored as omap data on an empty object in a rados
      pool, but python documentation is lacking. Local caching is possible
      with python dbm, and a separate thread can be used to avoid the usual
      service loop
  * Performance metrics could also be stored in general aquarium pool
    * [https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues/497](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues/497)
