* General
   * Due to resource constraints, concerned we won't get RGW - impact both
     backend and frontend - in to milestone 5. Suggestion to push the milestone
     back 1 week to cover
       * Team agreed to push back to the 6th of August, Alex will chat with
         Stephan and ensure he is happy with this new date

* Backend
   * introductory patch on network devices support
       * doesn't do much besides obtaining the devices
       * [https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/pull/603](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/pull/603)

* Frontend
   * gravel/glass: user management - 
     [https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/pull/578](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/pull/578) -
     Needs reviews
 
* Testing
   * Added cypress run at the end of PR check for openSUSE based distro: one
     simple test with few steps in installer
   * Ubuntu F02H ci check is malfunctioning because some kiwi dependency is
     broken
   * Our current Leap jeos image is 15.2, the latest is 15.3 but it does not
     have vagrant available in default official repo, that's stops us from
     switching to it.

* Backlog review
   * glass: installer issue should be resolved with dependency update
   * Milestone 5 update:
       * Gravel/backend: scope not entirely defined yet
       * Glass/frontend: scope not defined yet either
       * Scope for M5 postponed until next week

* Any other business
   * Feedback on the slides outlined in the department all-hands on
     "productizing" Aquarium?
       * Request for more broken out and detailed milestones for the project
         planning
       * Hope to be accepted into the GitHub Beta Program for the Project
         Management tool

* AI
