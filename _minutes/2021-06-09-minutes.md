* General
   * Changing the website to use Hugo:
     [https://themes.gohugo.io/](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
       * Any objections? Cleaner. Open to suggestion on which theme
       * Would fix:
         [https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarist-labs.github.io/issues/35](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarist-labs.github.io/issues/35)
   * Discussion forum
       * [https://github.com/aquarist-labs/forum/discussions/2](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/forum/discussions/2)
       * Joao: leave it open for future conversations
   * Milestone 4 is looking good:
     [https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/milestone/4](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/milestone/4)
       * 9 open issues, 3 in progress, 3 unassigned
       * Release on the 11th of June
           * Soft freeze on Fri. 11th June
           * Release on Mon. 14th June

* Backend
   * system disk being created on node deploy & mounted on boot if present
       * only for single-node at the moment, second node/join next
       * Currently aquarium boot script / mount thingy needs to happen so /etc
         is mounted, and only then can ceph start (ceph unit files don't exist
         until /etc is there). Would need to move the mount thingy much earlier
         in the boot cycle somehow. Joao suggested maybe it needs to live in
         the initrd, but let's not go there
           * The problem is systemd has already processed / loaded all the unit
             files it knows about *before* the mount happens
           * Actually might not matter too much -- aquarium can always just
             `systemctl start ceph.target`
               * Only likely a problem if Aquarium can't start for some reason,
                 but that needs manual intervention anyway, so >shrug<
               * If there's turns out to be a cleaner way, then yay
   * Mike Fritch should be starting on RGW real soon now
       * Sage apparently merged a bunch of HA stuff upstream but that should
         probably wait for next milestone
   * Discussion of local container registry in light of
     [https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/47286](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/47286)
       * Let's not do a local container registry, gets into too much site
         specific policy stuff
       * Way too much chicken and egg (how do you populate the registry anyway
         in an air-gap scenario?)
   * Bikeshed using Black for python code formatting

* Frontend
   * This week the installer has been improved by adding some nice workflow and
     information enhancements. A new dashboard widget is in progress to display
     the real used disc capacity.
   * Done:
       * glass: show disk solution during installer -
